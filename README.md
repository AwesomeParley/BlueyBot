# BlueyBot
Discord Bot for guessing Bluey Episodes
Based very closely to [Blueydle](https://blueydle.fun/).

## Features
### !guess command 
Allows users to see a screenshot from (or description of) an episode and guess the episode based on it. 
You have a default of 120 seconds per image to guess what the episode is from; if you fail, you get another image from the same episode to guess. You get 5 guesses, and if you fail all 5, it tells you what the episode is from.
### Settings
Allows the owner to set settings for the bot. Setting include:
- time per guess (default is 120 seconds)
- the guess command (default is "!guess")
- if reaction show up (default is True)
- if you want to set all text and images as spoilers (default is False)
- if you want Text Only mode (default is False)
All of these can be found in settings.txt
### Future Features
Here's some planned features:
- Server settings that can be edited by admins of each server
- plus more!
